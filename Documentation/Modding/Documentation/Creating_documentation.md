### Help creation
This page includes information about creating documentation files

Documentation files should use the `.md` format. The contents of the file should contain **GitHub Flavored Markdown** formatted text. Since the documentation will also be viewable in-game, only the formatting supported by [this addon](https://github.com/daenvil/MarkdownLabel) will work.

Put new documentation files inside one of the folders in the `Documentation` folder. If needed, create a new subfolder. The documentation files can be edited locally or in your browser using the editor on GitHub. When editing in GitHub, keep the formatting limitations described above in mind.

### File names
File names should start with a capital letter. Instead of a space " ", use an underscore _. Keep in mind that in the in-game menu, the file name will be the display name in the documentation list, and underscores will be replaced with spaces.
