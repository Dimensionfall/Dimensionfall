As of #807, dexterity and strength count a as a bonus for accuracy and damage on melee weapons. I want to make this moddable.

1.  modify melee weapon editor and create a field that will allow the user to enter stats. These stats will give a bonus to the accuracy and damage of the weapon. For example, if strength is 5, the calculations will add 5 damage to the attack. We will need one stat for accuracy and another stat for damage, so the editor also needs an input for each of them.
