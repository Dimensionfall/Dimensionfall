In a previous feature, we added DNpc and RNpc, and a NPC json file. This allows the game to load the NPC data and make it available to the game at runtime. Next, I want to make an editor so we can edit the NPC data in the content editor. We will need to add the DNpc to contenteditor.gd using its own contenttype called `DMod.ContentType.NPCS`. Then, we can call `load_content_list` for the NPC content type. This will load all NPCs (just 1 currently) into the content list in the content editor. When an NPC in the content_list is activated, it should open the NPC editor.

The NPC editor will be added as a new editor. To make the implementation go smoothly, we will use the `StatsEditor.gd` as an example of an editor with only a few fields. The NPC editor needs the same fields as the statseditor for sprite, id, name, description. Additionally, we need a spinbox for the health of the NPC. Similar to the StatsEditor, we need functions for saving and loading data.

Make sure to keep the scope of this feature limited and focus on the basic editing of the NPC.
