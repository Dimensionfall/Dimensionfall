You have the option to reload a magazine in the proximity inventory, but nothing happens when you do.

Steps to reproduce: 
1. Open the inventory next to a container with both bullets and magazines
2. Right click the magazine
3. Press reload
4. Observe nothing happens

Expected behavior: The magazine should be moved to the player inventory and then be reloaded. If the magazine does not fit in the player inventory, reload it in the proximity inventory. The proximity inventory appears when the player is close to a container, which represents a furniture or a collection of items on the ground.

Reloading the magazine in the player inventory still works.
