This feature will introduce NPC's to the game. Below are the requirements:

1. The NPC is defined by json, just like a mob. We will need a Dnpc and Rnpc class to load the json
8. Exclude any editors for the NPC's data for now, assume we edit the json manually
9. Create a generic NPC called hank in the dimensionfall mod.
10. The properties of the NPC are: name, description, sprite, id and possibly a few more to meet the requirements
