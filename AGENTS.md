## Development Flow
1. Start tasks from the workspace.
2. After modifications, run `gdformat path/to/modified_script.gd` on any script that was modified to properly format it.
3. Run the GUT tests:
   ```bash
   godot --headless --import
   godot --headless -s --path "$PWD" addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gexit -gdir=res://Tests/Unit
   ```
4. Report back any tests that fail.
5. Make sure that the requirements are satisfied.
